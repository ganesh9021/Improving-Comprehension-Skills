        <ul>
          Reading comprehension is the ability to read text, process it and
          understand its meaning. An individual's ability to comprehend text is
          influenced by their traits and skills, one of which is the ability to
          make inferences. If word recognition is difficult, students use too
          much of their processing capacity to read individual words, which
          interferes with their ability to comprehend what is read.

        <div>
          A graphic organizer, also known as knowledge map, concept map, story
          map, cognitive organizer, advance organizer, or concept diagram, is a
          communication tool that uses visual symbols to express knowledge,
          concepts, thoughts, or ideas, and the relationships between them.
        </div>
        <div>Some good examples for graphic organizers are :</div>
        <ul type="disc">

        <div>
          Students learn if they are able to grasp the concept and what they are
          reading. They learn to ask themselves questions that require thinking
          about more than one part of information and combine this information.
